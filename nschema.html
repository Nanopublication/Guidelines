    <section id="abstract">This document describes the Nanopublication schema</section>
    <section id="conformance">
      <h3>The Nanopublication Schema</h3>
      The nanopublication schema structures the three basic elements of a
      nanopublication: (i) the assertion, (ii) the provenance of the assertion,
      and (iii) the publication information of the nanopublication itself. It
      combines these elements into a single referencable entity: the
      nanopublication.<br>
      <br>
      Our reference nanopublication schema is defined in RDF, because RDF is our
      recommended exchange format for nanopublications <span>(Fig X)</span>.
      Thus, in version ... of the schema, a nanopublication is an instance of
      type 'np:Nanopublication'. It is linked to a named graph for the
      Assertion, Provenance, and PublicationInfo by the predicates '<em>hasAssertion</em>,
      <em>hasProvenance</em>, and <em>hasPublicationInfo</em> respectively. The
      named graphs contain the RDF statements that make up each of the elements.<br>
      <h4>Assertion</h4>
      The assertion graph of the nanopublication encapsulates one or more
      subject-predicate-object combinations. Examples are 'Malaria <em>is
        transmitted by</em> Mosquitos', or 'mutant HTT <em>causes</em>
      Huntingtin's Disease'. The RDF schema requires that each of these elements
      is represented by a URI (Universal Resource Identifier). We recommend
      obtaining these URI from commonly used thesauri and ontologies. <br>
      <br>
      If you are new to RDF, then it is non-trivial to create correct RDF
      statements for the assertion without supporting tools. Such tools are
      becoming available, but at this time we recommend collaboration with
      Semantic Web experts for converting assertions into valid RDF. We provide
      additional support in a separate document on Nanopublication design
      templates.&nbsp; The remainder of this document is a guideline who have
      some experience in Semantic Web modelling.<br>
      <h5>Choosing what to assert</h5>
      The scope of the assertion generally depends on what the author wishes to
      be known for and on the domain of discourse. We recommend to limit the
      assertion triples to the absolute minimum and precisely define for what
      statement credit is due. For instance, is it for the statement 'mutant
      Huntingtin <em>causes</em> Huntington's Disease' for which we have
      certain statistical evidence, or is it for the statistical method by which
      we found this relation? In the former case, the evidence could be in the
      provenance graph of the assertion, while in the latter case this evidence
      will be in the assertion graph, because <em>this is what we wish to get
        credit for</em>. <br>
      <br>
      We note that in the total RDF document, links may exist between elements
      in the assertion graph and those in the provenance graph, regardless of
      where we draw the boundaries of the named graphs. Furthermore, we
      anticipate that communities will have their own standard procedures and
      minimal requirements. If it is common in your domain to report evidence or
      error values with your assertion, then they SHOULD be included there.
      <br>
      <h4>Provenance</h4>
      Provenance means, ‘how this came to be’ and the provenance graph SHOULD
      include metadata statements for the assertion, such as the methods or
      parameter values used in creating the assertion, as well as attribution to
      authors, institutions, and funding sources (recommended publication
      roles…). The provenance graph SHOULD also contain a time/date stamp (using
      pro) and MAY contain links to DOIs and URLs. A nanopublication MUST have a
      provenance graph linked to the assertion (the subject being the
      "assertion").
      <em>[Tobias: The schema file says that the domain of hasProvenance is a
        Nanopublication, not an Assertion. Which one is correct?]</em>
      Additional metadata can be added to this minimal structure to accommodate
      a finer-grained array of evidence factors and attribution.<br>
      <br>
      A third graph called publicationInfo, contains provenance metadata
      statements referring to the creation of the nanopublication itself (the
      subject MUST be the "nanopublicaiton") and SHOULD contain attribution and
      a date/time stamp.
      <em>[Tobias: What's the difference between the timestamp in the provenance
        graph and the one in publicationInfo?]</em>
      <br>
      <br>
      In order to maintain flexibility there is no requirement for OWL. These
      recommendations will be exemplified and elaborated upon in a library of
      nanopublication templates http://nanopub.org/wordpress/?page_id=8. The CWA
      recommended nanopblucation schema is given below and can be linked to at
